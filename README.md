# Drowsiness Detection System

This project offers a **real-time solution** for identifying signs of drowsiness in people, particularly drivers. By utilizing non-invasive methods like the **eye aspect ratio (EAR)** calculated using facial landmarks, the system can accurately assess a person's condition without the need for specialized sensors or intrusive devices. The only requirement is a camera facing the person.

### Overview
The Drowsiness Detection System is a machine learning-based project that uses computer vision techniques to analyze eye activity. By calculating the **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)** using facial landmarks, the system can detect when a person is drowsy based on the closing of their eyes.

The goal of this project is to create a solution that can be implemented in real-time, such as in vehicles, to detect drowsiness in drivers and alert them before it leads to accidents.


### Face Landmarks

Face landmarks is a computer vision task that involves detecting specific points (also known as landmarks) on a face. For example, the eyes, nose, mouth, and chin. The objective is to accurately locate these landmarks in images or videos of faces in real-time and use them for various applications, such as face recognition, facial expression analysis, and drowsiness detection.

### EAR Formula

This formula is used to calculate the person's eye aspect ratio, which determines if the eyes are closed or open. If the eyes stay closed for a long time, we can say that the person is sleeping.

### Results

The program is able to detect if the person's eyes are closed if the person is properly light
