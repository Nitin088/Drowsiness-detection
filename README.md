# Drowsiness Detection System

This project offers a real-time solution for identifying signs of drowsiness in people. By utilizing non-invasive methods such as eye aspect ratio calculated using facial landmarks, the system can accurately assess the driverâ€™s condition without the need for specialized sensors or intrusive devices with the help of a camera facing the person.

### Face Landmarks

Face landmarks is a computer vision task that involves detecting specific points (also known as landmarks) on a face. For example, the eyes, nose, mouth, and chin. The objective is to accurately locate these landmarks in images or videos of faces in real-time and use them for various applications, such as face recognition, facial expression analysis, and drowsiness detection.

### EAR Formula

This formula is used to calculate the person's eye aspect ratio, which determines if the eyes are closed or open. If the eyes stay closed for a long time, we can say that the person is sleeping.

### Results

The program is able to detect if the person's eyes are closed if the person is properly light
